Instructional Lewis Structure Generator project through Processing

This program is a step-by-step builder of Lewis Structures for covalently bonded compounds. A molecule is requested by typing in a sequence of atoms, and a written narrative explains how to build the molecule and why the relevant bonds form, one step at a time.

This program is designed for use by students and teachers in general chemistry in high school and AP chemistry/introductory college chemistry students and teachers. An instruction component is implemented because I hope that students will use it as a guide to transition to being able to draw Lewis Structures for assessments and, more importantly, understand how and why chemical bonding works in this context.

It includes common covalently bonded compounds such as methane and water, as well as some slightly lesser known ones such as phthalic acid. Exceptions to the Octet Rule are involved for existing molecules. A total of 290 molecules and atoms are able to be drawn by this program. The program can easily be expanded to draw a greater number of molecules if the intended audience is different. 

The program was originally written for the Computer Science Innovations course at Winchester Thurston High School. It contains a total of 3,361 lines of code.
